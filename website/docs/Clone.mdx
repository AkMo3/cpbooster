`cpbooster` can clone a contest to your computer with the following command:

```shell
cpb clone
```


This command does 5 things:

1. Waits for [competitive companion extension](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion) to send the data from the contest.
1. Creates a folder inside your [contests directory](/docs/configuration#contestsdirectory-string) with the same name as the contest that you are cloning.
1. Creates source files for all the problems in the contest. Using the name of the corresponding problem as file name.
1. Loads the template that corresponds to your [preferred language](/docs/configuration#preferredlang-string) to each source file.
1. Downloads test cases as `.in` and `.ans` files. Using the name of the corresponging problem as file name as well.



## Demo
<div class="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/demos/clone.gif')} />
</div>

## File Structure

Running `ls` in the contest directory will show you something like the following.

```shell
Codeforces-CodeforcesRound665Div.2$ ls
A.DistanceandAxis.ans1  C.MereArray.ans1               E.DivideSquare.cpp
A.DistanceandAxis.cpp   C.MereArray.cpp                E.DivideSquare.in1
A.DistanceandAxis.in1   C.MereArray.in1                F.ReverseandSwap.ans1
A.DistanceandAxis.out1  D.MaximumDistributedTree.ans1  F.ReverseandSwap.ans2
B.TernarySequence.ans1  D.MaximumDistributedTree.cpp   F.ReverseandSwap.cpp
B.TernarySequence.cpp   D.MaximumDistributedTree.in1   F.ReverseandSwap.in1
B.TernarySequence.in1   E.DivideSquare.ans1
```

The first thing to notice is that every file that corresponds to the "X" problem has the same name as "X",
except for the extension. This is how `cpbooster` identifies which testcases correspond to a certain source file. 
This means that you could create a new test case attached to "X" just by creating the corresponding `X.in2` and `X.ans2`
files, however, `cpbooster` has a way to automate this task. See [Add Test Case](/docs/add-test-case).

The second thing to notice is that there are **no subfolders**!, the file structure is **flat**!, which is just amazing for several
reasons. See [Why Flat File Structure?](#why-flat-file-structure) to know more.

## Why Flat File Structure?

There are several reasons why a flat file structure is preferred when it comes to competitive programming constest.

But definitely main one, is because we want **speed!**, being fast in a contest is crucial.

For example, having to change directory like this

```shell
$ cd ..
$ cd ProblemB
```
each time you switch to another problem is just so annoying and slow.

Having a flat file structure enables you to make every single file operation easier and faster,
opening them, creating them, if you are a [vim](https://www.vim.org/about.php) or [neovim](https://neovim.io/) user you could just do

```shell
$ vim *.cpp
```
to open all your source files.

or let's say you want to see or modify the contents of some test case, you could just do `e: ProblemName.in1`
to open the file, without changing directory or using long relative paths.

Also, do not forget that folders **do** use space, even when they are empty, Why would you like to use more space just for a
competitive programming contest **???**

#### So, leave folders and organization for more complex projects! Here you definitely DON'T NEED that, it makes you slow.
