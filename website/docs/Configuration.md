`cpbooster` by default searches/creates for a configuration file named `cpbooster-config.json` in your **$HOME** directory.

## Creating Your First Configuration File

Execute the following command to create a configuration file:

```shell
cpbooster init
```

This command will create a file called `cpbooster-config.json` in your **$HOME** directory with default values.
If you wish to create your configuration file somewhere else you can specify this path in the `--config` flag when you run `cpbooster init`.

## Configuration File Example

```json

```
